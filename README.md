# Sentiment_analysis
Sentiment analysis, a vital branch of Natural Language Processing (NLP), is increasingly 
pivotal in understanding customer perspectives in industrial settings. This project specifically 
targets the analysis of customer reviews in an industrial context, aiming to decode and 
quantify the sentiments embedded within. By meticulously parsing through customer 
feedback, our objective is to develop a robust sentiment analysis model that can accurately 
discern and categorize emotional responses.
